This app will allow users to easily retrieve ERC20 and/or ERC721 tokens from Externally Owned Accounts (EOA's) that have their private keys exposed.     
Previously this would have been impossible because Ethereum is a [Dark Forest](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest).      
&nbsp;     
If you have an escrow contract, or otherwise have Ether locked please contact us at EmailAddress@EOAWatch.com.
